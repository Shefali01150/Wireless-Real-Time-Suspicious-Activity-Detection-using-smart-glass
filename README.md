# Wireless-Real-Time-Suspicious-Activity-Detection-using-smart-glass
Python model training using libraries, after receiving data analyse the blobs using algorithms and then to its classification methods with Raspberry Pi embedded coding to interact with hardware.

**Abstract:**

Today we live in a less secure world. That being said we are constantly under some threat, be it accidents on road or robbery etc. There are number of security systems which are installed to tackle these problems. Instead they record video and consume memory. It does not give any implication about the incident. To tackle these problems a real time suspicious activity detection system should be developed.
This system will have advantage over conventional system as it will continuously monitor the frame from particular camera. This can be implemented in any field using less amount of hardware. The system which we are designing is used to monitor the events taking place in frame of camera using image processing. In this paper we are using a Raspberry Pi as our main processor to which camera will be interfaced.
